# AWS F1 Static Site üèéÔ∏è

Formula 1‚Äìthemed static website deployed to AWS using **Terraform**, **Docker**, and optionally extended with **CloudFront**, **ACM (TLS)**, **GitHub Actions**, and **CloudWatch**.  
A homelab project that combines cloud engineering best practices with my passion for F1. üèÅ

## üöÄ Deployment Workflow

1. **Ubuntu VM Setup**  
   Created a dedicated VM (`ubuntu-aws`) with static IP `192.168.2.44` (Hamilton tribute üèéÔ∏è)

2. **SSH Key Integration**  
   Connected from Windows via `ssh ubuntu-aws` using secure key-based login

3. **Terraform Init & Apply**  
   Provisioned AWS S3 bucket and uploaded a custom F1-themed website

4. **Version Control**  
   Clean repo pushed to [GitHub](https://github.com/dj-3dub/aws-f1-static-site), excluding Terraform state and cache files
