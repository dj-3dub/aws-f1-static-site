##  ^=^z^` Deployment Workflow

1. **Ubuntu VM Setup**
   Created a dedicated VM (`ubuntu-aws`) with static IP `192.168.2.44` (Hamilton tribute  ^| )

2. **SSH Key Integration**
   Connected from Windows via `ssh ubuntu-aws` using secure key-based login

3. **Terraform Init & Apply**
   Provisioned AWS S3 bucket and uploaded a custom F1-themed website

4. **Version Control**
   Clean repo pushed to [GitHub](https://github.com/dj-3dub/aws-f1-static-site), excluding Terraform state and cache files

##  ^=^{   ^o Security

- IAM user with scoped-down permissions used for Terraform
- `.terraform/` and `.tfstate` files excluded via `.gitignore`

##  ^=^t^w Live Website

 ^=^l^p [f1-homelab-site-49c3df1f.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com](http://f1-homelab-site-49c3df1f.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/)

##  ^=^n  Next Goals

- [ ] Add **CloudFront** CDN
- [ ] Set up **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD deployments
- [ ] Monitor access logs via **CloudWatch**

##  ^=^y^l Why This Matters

This project isn't just a tech demo  ^`^t it's a personal reflection of my passion for Formula 1 and cloud engineering.
